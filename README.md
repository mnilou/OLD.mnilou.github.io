### Credit
> Github REACT templates were referenced along with course work. I received assistance from Corey Yates, UCSD Bootcamp tutor.

### Challenges
> I had a working repo and then received remote error messages in VSCode when I tried to commit. 
> I couldn't commit without first pulling from the main branch. Once I did that, many of my files were deleted and all the work I had done to the Project image section went missing.
> I spent hours trying to figure out how to fix the problem, but couldn't. Thankfully I didnt deploy, so what you have in the deployed app is missing the work that I did on the Project/image section.
