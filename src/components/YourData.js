    'As a small-business owner of an event planning company for the past 11 years, organization, self-motivation, and independent decision-making are a must. However, adaptability and thriving in a team environment with a collaborative effort is a forte to deliver quality web projects. My goal is to work directly with clients independently or as a collaborator, to ensure not only quality customer service, but quality products as well.',
